      <h2>Information</h2>

      <p>This document describes how to use the Clover for payment when using mFloor on a Clover Flex device.</p>

      <h2>Invoice Total screen</h2>

      <p>When using a Clover device, a new button labeled <b>Pay</b> will appear on the <b>Invoice Total</b> screen of mFloor.<br />
      This button triggers the payment with the Clover application by sending it the amount to be paid.</p>

      <h2>Payment Process</h2>

      <p>When pressing the <b>Pay</b> button, the Clover app opens asking to confirm the amount to be paid.<br />
      This amount is coming from mFloor directly and it's the full balance to pay.<br />
      Before completing this step, the Cashier can modify the amount if needed. When done, press the <b>Charge</b> button.</p>
      <img height="500" src="mFloor_Clover_files/Charge_Amount.jpg" width="283" /> 

      <p>The Clover device will display a screen with instructions for the customer. The next steps are to be completed by the card holder (ie: Tap, Insert or Swipe).</p>

      <p>Upon completion, the device is to be handed back to the cashier. The device will display a <b>Receipt Options</b> screen containing the following choices:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Printer Customer Receipt: This prints a bank stub directly from the Clover printer.</li>

        <li>Email: This button send a copy of the receipt via email to the customer <b>(The send receipt via email part of mFloor must be configured for this to work)</b>.</li>

        <li>Text Message: This button send a copy of the receipt to the customer's phone via text (This feature is not currently supported)</li>

        <li>Void Transaction: TBD</li>

        <li>Done: This button bring the cashier back to mFloor.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If the payment is not complete, mFloor will show the Invoice Total screen again with the updated balance to pay.</p>

      <h2>Detailed Transaction Receipts</h2>

      <p>Currently it is only possible to send the receipt via email to the customer. mFloor will look into the transaction header to find if there is an email.<br />
      If not, it will prompt the customer to enter his email address in order to get his receipt. As previously mentionned, the Clover device can still print a bank stub directly on its printer.</p>

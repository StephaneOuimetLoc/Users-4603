    <h1>eSuite - Weight Items</h1>

    <h2>Weight item Information</h2>

    <p>Weight items are those products sold by the&nbsp;kilogram&nbsp;or pound,&nbsp;such as meats and produce. These items have&nbsp;the price per kg/lb in the system and the price at the point of sale will vary item to item depending on the weight being purchased.</p>

    <p>You will find that these items can have a regular UPC or a PLU just like items sold by the each so they can be created in much the same way, we just need to make a couple of changes in POS Master to have them handled as weighted items at the point of sale.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>To create a Weight Item</h2>

    <p>From the launcher, select&nbsp;<strong>Items</strong> and choose <strong>New</strong> from the Start wizard</p>

    <p><img src="Weight_Item_files/ITM_NEW.png"></p>

    <p>By default item creation table&nbsp;opens, waiting for data input in Item Number field&nbsp;of the General Information table</p>

    <p><img width="1199" height="737" style="width: 1004px;" src="Weight_Item_files/ITM_Creation.png"></p>

    <p>1. Enter your UPC or PLU code, if it is not found, you will be asked to confirm the creation of a new item</p>

    <p><img src="Weight_Item_files/ITM_NewYN.png"></p>

    <p>2. Click yes, and you'll see that remainder of the 4 main information areas, General, POS, Price &amp; Cost,&nbsp;have become available for data entry</p>

    <p class="Note">Note: If the number entered is already in the database, &nbsp;the table will populate with the details for that product.</p>

    <p>3. Enter the item details in the General, POS, Cost and Price tables, paying particular attention to the FLAGS section of POS Information table.</p>

    <p>4.&nbsp;The POS information table is where we would ensure the system knows that the item is to be sold by the weight and there are&nbsp;2&nbsp;ways to inform the point of sale that this is the case.</p>

    <p class="indent4">a)&nbsp;If&nbsp;the&nbsp;entire sub-department&nbsp;is all sold by the weight, and setup as such, you can&nbsp;leave the default&nbsp;Flag of <strong>Follow sub</strong>:, checked off, as demonstrated below.</p>

    <p><img src="Weight_Item_files/ITM_POS_FSUBDPT.png"></p>

    <p class="indent4">b) If your sub-department has a mix of each and weight items, we must handle this setting item by item&nbsp;directly in the POS table.&nbsp; Simply uncheck Follow sub: and&nbsp;check off scaleable as shown.</p>

    <p><img src="Weight_Item_files/ITM_POS_SCALED.png"></p>

    <p>4. To save, click the&nbsp;<img width="41" height="17" style="width: 24px;" src="Weight_Item_files/TB_Check.png">&nbsp;in the tool bar of the Item Creation Table.</p>

    <p>5. Once you have saved your item you'll see that the&nbsp;Information tables become available to fully expand, providing access to additional fields.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><img src="Weight_Item_files/ITM_POSActive.png"></p>

    <p>6. Click on the edit box to expand the POS Edit table as there are a couple more flags,&nbsp;Manual &amp;&nbsp;Tare, to consider when selling by weight.</p>

    <p class="indent4">a) Manual - may need to be&nbsp;checked if the item is heavy or cumbersome for the client or cashier to place on the counter, it will allow the client to leave the item in the buggy and the cashier can manually enter the weight into the transaction</p>

    <p class="indent4">b) Tare - is used to offset the weight of the packaging so the customer pays only&nbsp;for the weight of the product and not the container it is packed in.</p>
    <img src="Weight_Item_files/ITM_POSMT.png"> 

    <p>7. Click the&nbsp;X to close the item creation&nbsp;table</p>

    <h2>To review your entry</h2>

    <p>1. From the Start wizard, choose the <strong>Items</strong> button instead of New&nbsp;</p>

    <p>2.&nbsp;Enter your item code&nbsp;into the <strong>Any code</strong> search field, and execute, be sure to check Show POS, Price and Cost if you wish to see those columns in the grid</p>

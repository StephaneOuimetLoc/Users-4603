    <h2>Table of Content</h2>

    <h3>Information</h3>

    <p>The training mode function is used for cashier's practices. Not all operations of the regular mode (regular sales) are available in the training mode; a list of unavailable functions in training mode appears at the end of the document. The difference between the training mode and the regular mode is that the sales perform in the training mode are not registered in the total sales.</p>

    <p class="Note">Note: Some features that are printing information do not print while in training mode. It is the case for the printed electronic coupons as well as the second invoice receipt when a charge or a payment on an account is performed.</p>

    <p>To start the training mode, please follow the next steps:</p>

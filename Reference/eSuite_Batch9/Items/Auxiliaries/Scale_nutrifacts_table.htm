      <h2>Information</h2>

      <p>The <b>Scale nutrifacts</b> table contains the nutritive elements for items that are made in the store. The <b>Scale nutrifacts</b> table works with the <b>Scale information</b> table.</p>

      <p>It includes a description, a declaration of the serving, a label template, as well as the mandatory (energy, proteins, fat and carbohydrates) and voluntary nutrients.</p>

      <h2>Displaying the Scale nutrifacts table</h2>

      <p>In the Launcher, click the arrow in the <strong>Items</strong> entry to display its menu and then:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Click on <strong>Auxiliary tables</strong>: the <strong>Start</strong> window opens in the <strong>Auxiliary</strong> work area.</li>

        <li>Click on <strong>Scale tables</strong> and then on the <strong>Scale nutrifacts</strong>: the <strong>Scale nutrifacts</strong> tab opens in the same window, displaying the <strong>Scale nutrifacts List</strong>.</li>

        <li>To modify an existing scale nutrifact, select it in the list and double-click on it, press the F3 key on the keyboard or click the <strong>Edit</strong> command in the bottom menu: the <strong>Scale nutrifacts</strong> table opens, overlapping the work area.</li>

        <li>To create a new scale nutrifact, click on <strong>Add</strong> in the bottom menu of the grid: the <strong>Scale nutrifacts</strong> table opens, overlapping the work area.</li>

      <p>The <strong>Sub-department (S-Dept)</strong> links the scale nutrifacts to a <a href="../../Dimensions/Dimensions_tables/Subdpt_table.htm">sub-department</a>.</p>

      <p>In most POS systems, item sales are linked to sale categories for reporting purposes. Because different POS systems use different terminology for sale links, it is important to understand the eSuite software terminology and how it relates to the POS system. The eSuite software uses a three-tier sale links level organization:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Item sales are accumulated in sub-departments;</li>

        <li>Sub-department sales are accumulated in departments (a department's sale total contains sales from one or more sub-departments);</li>

        <li>Department sales are accumulated in group sales (a group's sale total contains sales from one or more departments).</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The eSuite software sale link levels (sub-departments, departments and groups) are defined in the <b><a href="../../Dimensions/Dimensions_tables/Subdpt_table.htm">Sub-department</a></b> and <b><a href="../../Dimensions/Dimensions_tables/Department_table.htm">Department</a></b> tables.</p>

      <p>Whether or not the POS system uses the same terms, eSuite software requires that items be linked to a sub-department or to a first sale link level.</p>

      <p>To link the <strong>Scale</strong> <strong>Nutrifacts</strong> information to a sub-department, type the sub-department number in the <b>S-Dept</b> field or click on the chevron in the <b>S-Dept</b> field to select a sub-department from the drop-down list (records must already exist in the <span></span><b>Sub-department</b> <span></span>table for the <b></b>list to be displayed).</p>

      <h2>Information</h2>

      <p>The Deploy_Bitmaps.sql script is used to deploy images stored in the BitMaps folder of the Host server or the Store server (depending of the eCommerce solution scenario).</p>

      <p>When the Deploy_Bitmaps.sql script is executed, the BMP_GEN.SQI script is called and it populates/updates the BMP_TAB (Bitmaps table) on the Host server. Then, the images are zipped into one file and sent to the eCommerce server. Refer to the <u>Deploy Bitmaps</u> topic in Members.chm for delails.</p>

      <p>The same is true when a xStore_Deploy_load is called.&nbsp; The xStore_Deploy_load calls the xStore_bmp_load.sqm which calls the BMP_GEN script to populate the bitmaps directory at the target.</p>

      <h2>Images</h2>

      <p>Items Images must be saved into \Storeman\BitMaps directory of the Host server or the Store server (depending of the eCommerce solution scenario), the file name of the image must be composed of alpha numeric characters only, no space or special characters.</p>

      <h2>Management of images</h2>

      <p>To display images on the eStore and mStore applications, the Bitmap table must be populated and deployed to the eCommerce server. This is done by the deploy bitmaps process, which must be executed manually when the images are to be deployed. Refer to the <a href="../Deploy_Bitmaps/Deploy_Bitmaps.htm">Deploy_Bitmaps</a> topic for details.</p>

      <p>During the installation/upgrade of eSuite v4, the '54-Deploy Bitmaps' job is added in the scheduler.</p>

      <p>It is recommended to manage the images on the appropriate server according to the selected scenario:</p>

      <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead class="thead-dark">
          <tr>
            <th>eCommerce scenarios</th>

            <th>Where</th>

            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>

        <tr>
          <td>VLane with deployment from the Store server</td>

          <td>On the Store server</td>

          <td>The BitMaps folder and BMP_TAB are updated on the Store server and images of the eCommerce server are updated.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>VLane with deployment from the Host server</td>

          <td>On the Host server</td>

          <td>The BitMaps folder and BMP_TAB are updated on the Host server and images of the eCommerce server are updated.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>VStore with deployment from the Host server</td>

          <td>On the Host server</td>

          <td>The BitMaps folder and BMP_TAB are updated on the Host server and images of the eCommerce server are updated.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>VStore with deployment from each Store server</td>

          <td>On the Host server</td>

          <td>The BitMaps folder and BMP_TAB are updated on the Host server and images of the eCommerce server are updated.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p class="Note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> With the 'VStore with deployment from each Store server' scenario, the images can be managed at the Store level. However, it is important to know that the latest deployment overrides all previous deployments between the stores and/or the Host server. When the Deploy_Bitmaps.sql script is executed, images in the BitMaps folder and the BMP_TAB will be updated on the Host server. Then, the Host server will deploy the images to the eCommerce server.</p>

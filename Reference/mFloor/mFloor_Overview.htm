      <h2>Information</h2>

      <p>The SMS mFloor option provides a convenient, time-saving mobile solution accessible on smartphones and industrial mobile devices. The option's design is similar to the PDA concept, which may be familiar to some users, but provides additional features and runs on a variety of hardware and screen sizes.</p>

      <p>The mFloor option provides a slightly reduced set of the functionalities available in SMS that have been specifically chosen to be most useful in a mobile environment.</p>

      <h2><a name="Floor">On the floor</a></h2>

      <p>The mFloor solution provides convenient access to a number of SMS functions that can be used by store personnel and managers when on the store floor.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Price checks:</strong> In the event of a wrong label or inquiry from customers.</li>

        <li><strong>Inventory checks:</strong> When dealing with an out-of-stock shelf situation or answering a customers.</li>

        <li><strong>Item maintenance:</strong> If personnel need to change an item's description, price, package size, etc.</li>

        <li><strong>On floor purchasing:</strong> The purchasing module can be used to make mobile, opportune purchasing documents.</li>

        <li><strong>Sales orders:</strong> Items can be scanned and picked for sales orders directly on the store floor.</li>

        <li><strong>Label printing:</strong> Using a portable printer, labels can be conveniently printed in real-time or label batches can be prepared for later printing.</li>

        <li><strong>Inventory functions:</strong> mFloor provides a quick and easy method for performing regular store inventory and occasional cycle counts.</li>

        <li><strong>Line busting:</strong> Acting as a portable POS device, the mFloor option provides the new innovative function of entering&nbsp;customers' purchases, and then have them pay for their purchases at the store's regular POS counter.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="Stockroom">In the stockroom</a></h2>

      <p>In the store's stockroom, the mFloor solution provides a means to access SMS functionality without having to have a workstation installed or having to have the personnel go back and forth from the receiving/staging area to a workstation to perform their tasks.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Receiving:</strong> Using the built-in scanning capabilities of the mFloor solution, personnel can efficiently and accurately receive stock.</li>

        <li><strong>Inventory functions:</strong> mFloor provides a method for taking inventory of stock room items, ensuring that inventory checks on the floor reflect items in the store room as well.</li>

        <li><strong>Label printing:</strong> Items can be conveniently scanned to create batch printing jobs when placing items on the store floor. <strong></strong></li>

        <li><strong>Sales order fulfillment:</strong> If picking a large sales order, the scanning capabilities provided by mFloor reduce time and errors.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="Main">Main</a> menu</h2>

      <p>When a user first logs into mFloor, it opens to the main menu. This initial menu provides access to the main modules of the mFloor mobile solution and also provides a small button to return to the log in screen to allow another user login.</p>

      <p>The mFloor application was designed to work similarly to the PDA. However the screens and some of the functionalities have changed and this series of user help files provide detailed descriptions of each module and how to perform specific tasks.</p>

      <p>The image below mimics the Main menu of the mFloor application, click on the corresponding button for each module to view additional information for that module.</p>

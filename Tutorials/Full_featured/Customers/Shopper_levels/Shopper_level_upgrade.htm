      <h2>Information</h2>

      <p>The <a href="../Shopper_level_table.htm"><b>Shopper level</b> table</a> allows customers to upgrade to another shopper level in particular situations. This is useful for special promotions (discounts, more points, add-on amounts on vendor coupons, etc.) to customers when certain conditions are reached. This can be a good way of creating a certain movement in the store on slow moments.</p>

      <div class="Note">
        <b>NOTES:</b> 

        <ul>
          <li>The shopper level upgrade is valid for the current transaction only. The conditions are revaluated for each transaction.</li>

          <li>The shopper level upgrade is performed <i>when the <b>Sub-total</b> function is called in the transaction, so only one upgrade can be performed. It is not possible to upgrade a second time. For example, it is not possible to upgrade from shopper level 1 to shopper level 2 when the conditions are reached and immediately to shopper level 3 if the conditions of the shopper level 2 are also reached. Only the upgrade to shopper level 2 will be performed.</i></li>
        </ul>

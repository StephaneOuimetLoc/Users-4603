      <h2>Information</h2>

      <p>The <strong>More Criteria</strong> functionality is available in all wizards.</p>

      <p>The available selection options are different from Wizard to Wizards depending on where you are inside of your eSuite software.</p>

      <p>The <strong>More Criteria</strong> button works to allow you to add more detailed information to your query in order to be more percise to the information you are looking for.</p>

      <h2>How to use the <em>More Criteria</em> functionality</h2>

      <p>Once you are at the your wizard of choice you will always find the "<strong>More Criteria</strong>" button located just under the standard fields in the wizard. These additional fields would then be automatically into the wizard query. This example is based on <strong>Items - General list</strong></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Click on the "More Criteria" icon.<br />
         <img src="More_Criteria_function_files/img26.jpg" /><br />
        </li>

        <li>
          This will prompt a new pop-up window called, "<strong>Select Criteria</strong>". In this selection window you will have 5 different sections from where you may select advance details for your qurey. 

          <ul>
            <li>&nbsp;<em>Main Item</em></li>

            <li>&nbsp;<em>POS Information</em></li>

            <li>&nbsp;<em>Price Information</em></li>

            <li><em>Cost Information</em> &amp; 5 - <em>Other</em></li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          In the image below you can see your selection options on the left and notice the scroll bar on the right to move down &amp; up to the other sections metioned above you may desire.<br />
           <img src="More_Criteria_function_files/img29.jpg" />
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: none">
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>

        <li>In the "Select Criteria" pop-up window, you can click on the checkboxes you would like to all to your inital query.<br />
         <img src="More_Criteria_function_files/img2B.jpg" /><br />
        Once clicked you will notice the checkmark and red outlined of your selections.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Should you wish to change your selection you may simple uncheck the one you no longer require or you may use the "Unselect All" button located on the lower left side left side of this winodw.</p>

      <p>Once you are done with selecting your "More Criteria" up can then click on the "OK" Icon located on the buttom right hand corner. This will bring your selected "<strong>More Criteria</strong>" into the wizard window and populate under the 3 action buttons. See image below.<br />
       <img src="More_Criteria_function_files/img2D.jpg" /></p>

      <p>At this point here is where you may enter additional values into the listed options you have selected. Partial Item code will allow you to enter the digits you know for sure on in the item you would like to search. Eg: 4011 instead of entering "0000000004011" is Banana in our grocery lite sample. The Multiple search description allows you to enter text values that can bring up items that have exactly the same words in the same order or all items that have the text words you have entered. Eg. red gold.<br />
       <img src="More_Criteria_function_files/img2F.jpg" /></p>

      <p>In order to have your query executed to view your results you would then simply click on the Execute button located at the buttom right hand corner of the Wizard.</p>

      <p>This action will prompt the "Item - General list" grid result with your information request.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;See image below.<br />
       <img src="More_Criteria_function_files/img31.jpg" /><br />
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>&nbsp;Should you use these "More Criteria's" selections more often, you can save these details as a "Saved Query" to be selected without going through the steps again. You may click on this "Save Query" <img class="Text" height="24" src="Grab_fields_function/Save_query_icon.png" width="28" /> icon in the wizard located just below the "X" in the top right hand corner.<br />
        <br />
         <img src="More_Criteria_function_files/img33.jpg" /></li>

        <li>This will prompt a new pop-up window called, "Save Search" where you will be required to enter a name to save your configuration. This name will be avaiable to be select from the listing once you click on the "Save Query" icon.<br />
         <img src="More_Criteria_function_files/img35.jpg" /></li>

        <li>
          Set the conditions of the selected fields, and then click <strong>Execute</strong> to get the expected results.<br />
           <img src="More_Criteria_function_files/img37.jpg" /><br />
          <br />
           
          <p class="NoteList" /><strong>NOTE:</strong> The fields selected using the <strong>Grab fields</strong> functionality can be used with the <strong>More Criteria</strong> function as well as any information entered in the top fields of the <strong>Wizard</strong> to get the expected results.

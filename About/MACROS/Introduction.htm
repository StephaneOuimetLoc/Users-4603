<h1>SMS Macro</h1>

<p>LOC SMS supports its own set of Macro commands. These commands are proprietary, and have been created to access
features related to LOC SMS only. All LOC SMS commands start with an @
character.</p>
<p>The concept of the &quot;macro functions&quot; is that the command will be replaced by 
the result of the macro function. This replacement can be very powerful if you 
think about putting the macro functions in a template. When the template is 
being parsed, the macro functions are replaced with the result of the function. 
The macro functions can also be used in any other command string. The embedded 
macro functions will first be replaced before the command is executed. A macro 
function can be include as a parameter for another functions and so on. <br><br>
There is pretty large number of macro functions. Ranging from the simple system 
information to a complete report generating macro.</p>
<p>All macro name are not case sensitive.<br><br>All variable names are not case 
sensitive.<br><br>The parameters are separated by a comma and no space and no 
carriage return. The space is use for a string parameter.</p>
<p>A macro can have a semicolon at the end for better visibility, but it is not 
required.</p>
<p>It's possible to put remark in the file by using these delimited start = /* 
end = */ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ex: @WizRpl(MyParam=12); /* Remark: Set 
MyParam to 12 */<br></p>

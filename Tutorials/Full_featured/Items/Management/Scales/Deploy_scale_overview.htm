      <h2 id="RW">Random Weight Items</h2>

      <p>Random Weight item formats can be <a href="#weighed">weighed</a> or <a href="#bycount">by count</a>. The barcode printed on the label is a specific format: Leading with a 002 or 02, followed by 5 or 6 digits for the PLU of the item, then 4 to 5 more digits containing the actual sale price.<br>
      The barcode contains the sale price, not the sell price and a check digit to ensure barcode validity.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>In some places, such as Latin America, the barcode may contain the weight of the item as opposed to the sale price. Configuration varies depending on the physical scale settings. Please refer to the most common examples in the table below.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 id="weighed">Weighed Items</h3>

      <p>Weighed Random Weight items, are items that are weighed on production scales in departments such as: Deli; Meat; Fruit and Vegetable. Once an item is weighed, the scale will print a label with the price.</p>

      <p>When the item is scanned at the POS, the barcode will be decoded and the PLU will be used to find the item. The item will be added to the sale, using the sell price on the item, example $19.99/kg. The POS will then take the sale value from the barcode and divide it by the sell price to get a quantity, for example $5.00/$19.99 = 0.25; <strong><em>e.g.:</em></strong> <em>Mozzarella is priced at $19.99/kg and the customer gets a piece weighing 0.25 kg. The item is worth $5.00. The scale will produce a label with a barcode on it which is placed on the mozzarella. When this is scanned at the front-end POS, the mozzarella will be added to the sale at $5.00.</em></p>

      <p>For steps on how to program a weighed item, see <a href="#weighed0">Weighed</a> items topic in <strong>Deploying Items</strong> section below.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

      <h3 id="bycount">By Count Items</h3>

      <p>By Count items, are items that are normally pre-packaged at the same price, with the same or slight variance in weight. The scale will print a label for the price; <strong><em>e.g.:</em></strong> <em>Chicken wings are priced at 0.35¢/each and the customer gets 10 wings. The box is worth $3.50. The scale will produce a label with a barcode on it which is placed on the box containing the chicken wings. When this is scanned at the front-end POS, the box of chicken wings will be added to the sale at $3.50.</em></p>

      <p>For steps on how to program a by count item, see <a href="#bycount0">By Count</a> items topic in the <strong>Deploying Items</strong> section below.</p>

      <p class="Note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> 'By Count' items that are <span class="auto-style3">weighed</span> are <em>not</em> supported by many scales, <em>do not</em> set if not supported by the scale.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

      <h3 id="specific">Specific Behavior flags</h3>

      <p>In some cases specific flags can be set to configure special behaviors for scalable items. For details of particular behaviors, see <a href="#Specific">Specific Behavior flags</a> topic in section below.</p>

      <div>
        <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
      </div>

      <h3 id="exception">Exception flags</h3>

      <p>Exception flags are used to add settings that are unsupported by eSuite. They consist of manually programmed item values in order to achieve scale specific behavior(s) and passed in the HOSTCHNG file. They can be added to the <strong>URL</strong> <em>(F2660)</em> field in the <strong>POS</strong> table in eSuite.</p>

      <p>For context, new features are regularly added to the market for production scales (existing or non-existing). To support these features, Invatron adds fields to their driver(s). By using exception flags, it is possible to use these new fields without having to wait for the next version/release of eSuite.</p>

      <p class="Note"><strong>NOTES</strong><br>
      • Exception flags may also be used to support existing Invatron parameters, which were not added to eSuite.<br>
      • If using the URL field, do not duplicate a key that already exists in eSuite.</p>

      <h6>Print Packaged Date/Time</h6>

      <p>In order to enable <em>Print Packaged Date</em> and <em>Print Packaged Time</em> for production scale labels, a value needs to be entered into the <strong>URL</strong> <em>(F2660)</em> field of the <strong>POS</strong> table.</p>

        <li><strong>Scale Fix Weight</strong> - A scale fix weight item is an item that has no variance in weight. <strong><em><br>
        e.g.:</em></strong> <em>Box of frozen salmon filet, individual portion, 6oz.</em></li>

        <li><strong>Scale Fix Weight by Count</strong> - A scale fix weight by count item is an item that has no variance in weight and is calculated by unit. The weight is tracked for inventory purposes. <strong><em><br>
        e.g.:</em></strong> <em>Store made cookies. Each cookie weighs 3 ounces but is sold by unit, 1/$1.00.</em></li>

        <li><strong>Scale Fix Price</strong> - A scale fix price item is an item that has no variance in price. Weight may differ slightly, price remains the same. <strong><em><br>
        e.g.:</em></strong> <em>A pack of 5 boneless chicken breast at $10.00/pack.</em></li>

        <li><strong>Scale Open Price</strong> - A scale open price item is an item that does not have a set price. The operator will be prompted to enter a price value once having placed the item on the scale. The system will calculate the weight versus price entered to provide sale amount<strong><em>.<br>
         e.g:</em></strong> <em>Applies to any regular random weight item, but allows item price to be modified at the scale.</em></li>

        <li>
          <strong>Scale Turkeyware</strong> - A scale turkeyware item is an item that is weighable and by count. The turkey is being sold by unit regardless of its weight. The weight is tracked for inventory purposes, as normally throughout the year the item would be sold dollar per pound/kilogram. <strong><em><br>
           e.g:</em></strong> <em>Thanksgiving Holiday - Turkey Special, 3/$30.00.<br>
          </em> <strong></strong>

          <div class="alert alert-warning">

        </li>

        <li><strong>Scale Force Tare</strong> - A scale force tare item is an item that does not have an automatic tare set. The operator will be prompted to enter a tare value once having placed the container on the scale. Then, the tare will be zeroed out to proceed with weighing the item(s). The customer is charged for the weight of the item(s), not the container.<br>
        <strong><em>e.g:</em></strong> <em>Popcorn chicken $1.00/gram - Small, Medium, Large formats (Small box = 0.5 grams, Medium box = 0.8 grams, Large box = 1 gram).</em></li>

    <p class="Note">A customer must be entered for each transaction charged to a customer's account. A credit limit limits the amount that can be charged to customers account.</p>

    <p>To charge an invoice to&nbsp;a customer's account, please follow the next steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <div>
          At the end of the transaction, select the desired customer, if they are not already selected.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          Select the Charge option from the tenders pull-down menu. The "Charge?" message will be displayed in the entry window.

      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          In the entry window, enter the amount charged to the customer's account. The specified amount is charged to the customer's account.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="Note">To complete the transaction, the balance must be $0.00. The credit limit of the customer's account is defined in the Risk level table (which is linked to the customer table.)

    <h1>Save Query functionality</h1>

    <p>The powerful function allows the end-user to save many preferences that they would use on a regular basis. Saving time and enabling other users the ability to benefit from these saved queries in or to provide them with the exact information they desire to view with simply selecting the created <strong>Save Query</strong> of their choice. No more re-renting the same details over and over every day.</p>

    <p>Weather it be for a specific <strong>Targets</strong>, <strong>Vendor</strong>, <strong>Sub-department</strong>, <strong>Category</strong> that may also include additional details from the <strong>More Criteria</strong> options, selections from the <strong>Grab Fields</strong> functionality, preferred result grid <strong>Layout</strong> and <strong>table</strong> information such as <strong>POS</strong>, <strong>Price</strong>, <strong>Cost</strong> even the <strong>Breakdown</strong> of the information (ex: by store, by date, by item). We have also included the fields of the <strong>Top Results</strong>, <strong>Top Pivot records</strong> and the <strong>Server Timeout(s)</strong> which are found when you click on the Gearbox icon <img height="31" src="Save_Query_Function_files/Gearbox_Icon.png" width="27" class="inline" /> to the right of the Execute button. In other words anything this that in available in the <strong>Wizard</strong> can be a part of the created <strong>Save Query Functionality</strong>.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Save Query</strong> functionality can be found within all <strong>Wizard</strong> windows of eSuite. Look for this icon <img class="inline" src="Save_Query_Function_files/Save_Query_Icon.png" style="height: 22px" width="22" /> on the right hand side in the blue line just below the "X" icon action to close the Wizard. Once you have entered all you desired field values you may then create your <strong>Save Query</strong> by clicking on the above mentioned Icon. For the following example we'll be using the Items - General list see image below.</p>

    <table style="width: 92%">
      <tr>
        <td class="auto-style1" style="width: 383px">&nbsp;default Wizard displayed</td>

        <td class="auto-style1" style="width: 384px">desired Wizard displayed</td>

        <td class="auto-style1" style="width: 384px">desired Records &amp; Server values</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td style="width: 383px"><img src="Save_Query_Function_files/img5.jpg" /></td>

        <td style="width: 384px"><img src="Save_Query_Function_files/img7.jpg" /></td>

        <td class="auto-style1" style="width: 384px"><img src="Save_Query_Function_files/img8.jpg" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p class="Note">Note: You can either have the <em>fields displayed</em> as a <strong>Save Query</strong> or you may also save the <em>detailed values in the fields</em> to populate every time. As seen above example; Target, Sub-department and Promotion ID = 00003. Even when your <strong>Saved Query</strong> is selected you may change the field values and or add additional fields and values. If you're constantly adding to your initial <strong>Saved Query</strong> maybe you should consider creating another one.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h1>How to use the Save Query functionality</h1>

    <p>When inside a Wizard window once you have selected the desired fields and values, click on the Save Query icon <img src="Save_Query_Function_files/Save_Query_Icon.png" style="height: 22px" width="22" /> you will then be prompted "<strong>Saved New Configuration</strong>" as seen below</p>

    <p><img src="Save_Query_Function_files/imgD.gif" /></p>

    <p>Clicking on this will open a "<strong>Save Search</strong>" pop-up window. You must enter a name in order to save the query then click on the "<strong>Ok</strong>" button. You may also choose to have your created Save Query, made "<strong>Public</strong>" by selecting the checkbox. Allowing all created end-users to access this Saved Query or keep it "<strong>Private</strong>", which mean only you will have access to this Saved Query should you not select the checkbox.</p>

    <p><img src="Save_Query_Function_files/imgF.jpg" /></p>

    <p>This example of Saved Query is call, "Query2022" and once saved you may then click on "<strong>Execute</strong>" button to view your desired query.</p>

    <p>This will populated only the details that are pertaining to what you have requested to be viewed in the grid results.</p>

    <p>You may delete any created <strong>Saved Query</strong> simply by selecting the query and then clicking back in the Save Query icon <img src="Save_Query_Function_files/Save_Query_Icon.png" style="height: 22px" width="22" /> and the delete option will be shown toward the bottom as seen in the image below.</p>

      <h2><a name="Top0"></a>Information</h2>

      <p>A <strong>Pivot table</strong> is a statistics tool that summarizes and reorganizes selected columns and rows of data in a spreadsheet or database table to obtain a desired report. The tool does not actually change the spreadsheet or database itself, it simply “pivots” or turns the data to view it from different perspectives.</p>

      <p>Pivot tables are especially useful with large amounts of data that would be time-consuming to calculate by hand. A few data processing functions a <strong>Pivot table</strong> can perform include identifying sums, averages, ranges or outliers. The table then arranges this information in a simple, meaningful layout that draws attention to key values.</p>

      <h2>How pivot tables work</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Columns:</strong> When a field is chosen for the column area, only the unique values of the field are listed across the top.</li>

        <li><strong>Rows:</strong> When a field is chosen for the row area, it populates as the first column. Similar to the columns, all row labels are the unique values and duplicates are removed.</li>

        <li><strong>Values:</strong> Each value is kept in a pivot table cell and display the summarized information. The most common values are sum, average, minimum and maximum.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For example, a store owner might list monthly sales totals for a large number of merchandise items in an Excel spreadsheet. If they wanted to know which items sold better in a particular financial quarter, they could use a pivot table. The sales quarters would be listed across the top as column labels and the products would be listed in the first column as rows. The values in the worksheet would show the sum of sales for each product in each quarter. A filter could then be applied to only show specific quarters, specific products or averages.</p>

      <h2>Uses for a pivot table</h2>

      <p>A pivot table helps users answer business questions with minimal effort. Common pivot table uses include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="List">To calculate sums or averages in business situations. For example, counting sales by department or region.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="List">To show totals as a percentage of a whole. For example, comparing sales for a specific product to total sales.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="List">To generate a list of unique values. For example, showing which states or countries have ordered a product.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="List">To identify the maximum and minimum values of a dataset.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pivot table feature can be found in reports such as the;</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="List">Cost of Goods reports</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="List">Items, Single, Multi, Compare totals reports</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="List">Customers Single, Multi, Compare totals, Transaction analysis reports and others areas.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="NoteList"><strong>NOTE:</strong> In order to access the Pivot table option icon you will need to generate a report first.</p>

      <p>Seen in this image below is the where you will locate the Pivot table icon. Ex: Cost of Goods report</p>

      <p><img class="Text" height="878" src="Pivot_table_files/Pivot_table_icon.png" width="1241"></p>

      <p>Once you have click on the Pivot Table icon <img class="Text" height="22" src="Pivot_table_files/Pivot_table_small_icon.png" width="21"> it will open a new tab and this view will allow you to create the desired pivot view.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Listing all the avaialble fields that can be utilized and simply drag and drop into the the Values, Row and Column labels.</p>

      <p><img class="Text" height="962" src="Pivot_table_files/Pivot_table_areas.png" width="1136"></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>In the Pivot Table example the desire view is to easily view the items amounts, Item Quantity and Markdowns per Department decsription</p>

      <p><img height="961" src="Pivot_table_files/Pivot_table_info_displayed.png" width="1254" class="Text"></p>

      <p>Once you have your desired view set you may then close the right details "Configurator" to have a more complete view of your created Pivot table.</p>

      <p><img class="Text" height="861" src="Pivot_table_files/Close_config.png" width="423"></p>

      <p>Providing you with the full view of your created Pivot table with use of the scroll bar are the bottom to move through the report and the grand totals are at the end of the view as seen in the image below.</p>

      <p><img class="Text" height="853" src="Pivot_table_files/Pivot_table_full_view.png" width="1254"></p>

      <p>Should you tend to view Pivot table with the same values and layout often you may save these Pivot "Layouts" so that you can select it from the Wizard, rather than create them each time.</p>

      <p>This can be done by clicking on the "General setting" icon <img class="Text" height="24" src="Pivot_table_files/General_setting_icon.png" width="24"> location at the top right of the window, below the "<strong>X</strong>". Click on the General setting icon will open the option list. There is where you will be able to select "Save layout" feature. See below image.</p>

      <p><img class="Text" height="851" src="Pivot_table_files/Pivot_table_save_layout.png" width="1438"></p>

      <p>The "Grid Layout setting" window will prompt where you will need to enter the name of the Layout and then you may click the "Save" button to submit you new layout preference.</p>

      <p><img class="Text" height="200" src="Pivot_table_files/Pivot_table_save_layout_entry.png" width="560"></p>

      <p>Once the Pivot layout is saved if then become available to be select from the Wizard, you need to click on the drop down button in the "Layout" field. See image below. You may have multiple layouts saved should you desire.</p>

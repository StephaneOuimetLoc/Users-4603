      <h2>Information</h2>

      <p>This document describes how to work with the receiving module and perform the tasks described below:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#receiving_document">Receiving a closed purchase order or open receiving document</a></li>

        <li><a href="#creating_receiving_document">Creating a receiving document</a></li>

      </ul>

      <h2 id="receiving_document">Receiving a closed purchase order or open receiving document</h2>

      <p>The following procedure assumes that a purchase order has been created either in mFloor or in the Back office server or workstation, has been closed and submitted to the vendor, or that a receiving document has been created in mFloor or in the SMS Back office server or workstation and has an open status.</p>

      <p><strong>To receive a closed purchase order or open receiving document follow the procedure below:</strong></p>

      <ol>
        <li>Tap or click on <strong>Receiving</strong> from the Buying module menu.</li>

        <li>The receiving menu opens on the <strong>Open receiving</strong> screen. The lower part of the screen (A) displays closed purchase orders ready to be received or open receiving documents. The difference between the two types of receiving documents is seen by looking for the PO# (B) Purchase orders that are closed and submitted to vendors display a PO#, open receiving documents do not show the PO#.<br />

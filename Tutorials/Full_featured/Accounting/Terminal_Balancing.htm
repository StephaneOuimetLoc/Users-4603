      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The operator or cashier is responsible for the funds in the cash drawer from the time they are loaned to them, as a float, along with any sales they may do and this right up to the time they declare their drawer at the end of their shift.</p>

      <p>When SMS is first installed at a location it is set for operator balancing and the majority of the balancing examples seen in this help file are based on this mode of balancing, i.e.: the operator or cashier is responsible for the funds in the cash drawer from the time they are loaned to them, as a float, along with any sales they may do and this right up to the time they declare their drawer at the end of their shift. In most cases each operator or cashier is assigned a cash drawer and register. In this scenario, reports are run per operator and reports display the loans, sales, pickups and declares for each operator and drawer.</p>

      <h2>Terminal Balancing</h2>

      <p>For smaller stores that may have a limited number of cash registers or POS workstations and several cashiers who use the same register, operator balancing may be impractical or difficult to manage, in this case the LOC SMS system can be configured to perform terminal balancing. In terminal balancing, the responsibility for the funds in the cash drawer is on the terminal itself. This is done by configuring each terminal with a "Virtual" operator for the balancing operations: Loans(floats), pickups and declares. Operators log into the terminal with their own operator number and their sales/returns and statistics information such as number of customers, percent scanned, etc... is tracked by their operator account. The diagram below displays the concept of Terminal balancing:</p>

      <h2>Reporting</h2>

      <p>In Terminal Balancing, reports for operators display sales/revenues for the "logged in" operators at the terminal, whereas the "Virtual" operator reports display information on loans, pickups and declares for the terminal. Note the information in different columns in the report below.</p>

      <h2>Setting up terminal balancing</h2>

      <p>Configuration of terminal balancing requires two steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>A LOC certified technician</strong> must add a prefix in a special <em>DrawerTerminalPrefix</em> field under the Balancing heading of the Client section of <strong>System.ini</strong> file of each terminal.</li>

        <li style="list-style: none">
          <p class="alert alert-warning"><strong>NOTE:</strong> In the example below the <strong>TerminalPrefix</strong> is the store number <strong>123</strong>, however it can be any arbritray number as long as the virtual operator numbers (shown below) are prefixed with the same number.</p>

          <p><img width="659" height="479" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="" src="Terminal_Balancing_files/Termianprefix.png" /></p>
        </li>

        <li>The store manager adds virtual operator(s) number(s) for each terminal in the store. This is done using the <strong>Operators</strong> function in the eSuite Manage module under the Operator's tab.</li>

        <li style="list-style: none">
          <p class="alert alert-info"><strong>Ex.:</strong> The manager has set up two virtual operators associated to the cash register terminal POS 1 &amp; 2 by combining the <strong>TerminalPrefix</strong> number with the number of the POS terminal.</p>

        </li>
      </ol>

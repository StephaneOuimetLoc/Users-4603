    <h1>eSuite - Sub-Department Table</h1>

    <p>eSuite &gt; Dimensions &gt; Sub-Departments &gt; List</p>

    <h2>Table of Contentsssssssssssssssssssssss9999999999999 Information</h2>

    <p>000000000000000000000</p>

    <p>The <strong>Sub-department</strong> table contains information for groups of items. The&nbsp;eSuite software uses sub-departments as a way of grouping both coded items and direct key sales for reporting.</p>

    <p>Instead of linking coded items directly to departments, eSuite uses sub-departments to group items, and then links the sub-departments to departments. This allows for another report level, regrouping item codes in a more specific manner.</p>

    <p>Sub-departments also have their own settings, such as taxability, maximum and minimum entries for sales and voids etc.,&nbsp;to be applied&nbsp;when direct key sales are performed. Coded items can also be programmed to follow these settings using the POS Master table.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="Note">Note:&nbsp;<br>
     The eSuite software does not support sub-department programming for all types of points of sale, as such sub-department information may not get through to all points of sale<br>
    <br>
     Sub-department table must be programmed to use the sub-departments for reporting purposes</p>

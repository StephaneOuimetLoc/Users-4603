      <p>You may or may not have noticed that there are new options in the "More criteria" as well as the new alphabetical order in which it is now displayed.</p>

      <p>This makes it easier to read and located the listed options you are searching for criteria's you wish to add to your search query.</p>

      <p>In order to facilitate Customer search by name we have added 2 new search fields - <em>Customer first name</em> and <em>Customer last name</em>. These will make it easier to find who you are looking for as some end-user have changed the automatic populated "<strong>Legal name</strong>" field to the customer's company name of said Customer's (Last,First names) details. Which at times would make it difficlut to search by the actual Customer name.</p>

      <p><img src="Customer_Wizard_files/More_criteria_names.png" style="height: 521px" width="542" /></p>

      <p>Once you have selected on or both of these fields you may then select "<strong>OK</strong>" button and they will be apart of your query after you enter the text that you are seaching for.</p>

      <p>Simply click on the <strong>Execute</strong> button and the system will bring up all customers who may have the vaule you have entered.</p>

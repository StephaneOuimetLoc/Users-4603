    <h2>Information</h2>

    <p>This report calculates points given, expired, adjusted, and redeemed at a date range and compares the points with the current balance.</p>

    <p>Provides drill down to view the points transaction details information.</p>

    <h2>Navigation</h2>

    <p>The user can access it under <strong>eSuite Care</strong> / <strong>Points</strong> / <strong>Point summary</strong></p>

    </div>

    <h2>Details of Wizard Fields</h2>

    <p>Date panel</p>

    <div>
      <img alt="" src="point_summary_report_files/date_panel.png" />
    </div>

    <p>This component is the standard date panel used in eSuite in all other wizards.</p>

    <p>For this report, by default the period Month is selected.&nbsp;The detailed periods Week by day, Month by day Month by week Year by week and Year by month are not used since the result is generated based on the chosen dates only.</p>

    <p><strong>Customer ID:</strong></p>

    <p>We can display results for specific customers, just by entering their ID (F1148) in this field, separated by comma.</p>

    <p>If using the More criteria button with a customer range instead, or if we want to have all customers, we should leave it empty.</p>

    <p><strong>Company legal name:</strong> Allows to search for customers having the same company name, (F1155)</p>

    <div>
      <img alt="" src="point_summary_report_files/companyname.png" />
    </div>

    <p><strong>Points balance:</strong> Allows to search for all customers for a point program.&nbsp; We can put many programs, separated by a comma.</p>

    <div>
      <img alt="" src="point_summary_report_files/point balance.png" />
    </div>

    <p><strong>Customer type:</strong>&nbsp;When using this report on a host with SMS Payment, the points should be in Centralized account.&nbsp; If using this on a server store using native points in SMS, we should use Local Account.</p>

    <div>
      <img alt="" src="point_summary_report_files/customertype.png" />
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Centralized:</strong> the results will be taken from tables RPT_PAY adding current period details from TRS_PAY.</li>

      <li><strong>Local account:</strong> the results will be taken from native tables of SMS RPT_CLT_M&nbsp; adding current period details from RPT_CLT_D.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="Note"><strong>NOTE</strong>: There is no way actually in eSuite to automatically select one choice or the other based on SMS options that are installed.&nbsp; We should do this in the future so when SMS Payment is installed and this report is run from a host.</p>

    <p><strong>Target / More criteria / Layout</strong></p>

    <p>(Standard in eSuite: Target works the same way than all other reports in SMS and eSuite based on target that are for Reports.</p>

    <div>
      <img alt="" src="point_summary_report_files/target.png" />
    </div>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3><strong>More criteria button</strong></h3>

    <p>searching from many other fields. It is a ed to the other fields listed above. When using a customercondition add range in addition to putting also text in the Customer ID field, the range must include this customer to get all the conditions working together.</p>

    <p><b>Breakdown</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>By date:</strong> The results will be generated by date and should have 1 line by date (or more if other breakdowns are used).&nbsp; The date column should appear first in the result grid.</li>

      <li><strong>By store:</strong> The results will be generated by store and should have 1 line by store (or more if other breakdown used) The store column should appear first in the result grid.</li>

      <li><strong>By customer:</strong> The results will be generated by customer and should have 1 line by customer.&nbsp; The customer Id column should appear first in the result grid.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Show only difference between calculated and current</strong></p>

    <p>When the option is checked, the results will only be displayed if there is a difference between calculated amount and totals.</p>

    <p><strong>Execution:</strong> When executing this wizard, the result grid is displayed in another tab on the top of the current window with the title Summary</p>

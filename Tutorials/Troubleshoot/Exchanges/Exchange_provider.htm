      <h2>Information</h2>

      <p>The <strong>Exchange provider</strong> manages and carries out the important task of controlling the exchange of information between the back office server and the front end workstations or the head office and the stores.</p>

      <p>The process is similar in concept to the electronic mail, with inbox and outbox folders for each store, server and terminal/lane configured for the communication exchange. The information exchange process requires several steps for sending and receiving data, including checking exchange mailboxes and the scheduler list for activities.</p>

      <h2>Monitoring exchange messages</h2>

      <p>One of the most important daily store tasks is monitoring the results of exchange communications in the <strong>Messages</strong> section of the <strong>eSuite System</strong> module. If errors occur during the data transfer, the system writes an urgent message that includes the details of the error. Successful communications are noted as normal messages. If errors occur during the communication process, the system will set the status of this terminal to <em>offline</em>, putting a hold on normal communications. The terminal stays offline until its status is manually reset to <em>online</em>.</p>

      <h2>Displaying the exchange provider</h2>

      <p>In the Launcher, click the <strong>Exchanges</strong> entry:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The <strong>Start</strong> window opens in the <strong>Exchange</strong> work area.</li>

        <li>Click on <strong>Exchange provider</strong>: the exchange provider opens in the <strong>Provider</strong> tab.</li>

      <h2>Stopping/Restarting Communications in the Exchange Provider</h2>

      <p>The <strong>Exchange provider</strong> uses a programmable clock cycle to determine the frequency of the terminal's activities. As a user, there are only a few reasons to check the <strong>Exchange provider</strong>. For the most part, after it has been configured, the <strong>Exchange provider</strong> acts on its own, without any user intervention.</p>

      <p>However, there are occasions that require a manual intervention, like communication issues. If a POS terminal (front end workstation) is removed on purpose from the network, for example due to maintenance, the <strong>Exchange provider</strong> must stop trying to communicate with this missing terminal until it has been returned to the network. If a temporary communication failure has been corrected, the user may need to force the <strong>Exchange provider</strong> to restart the communication.</p>

      <h3>Stopping communications</h3>

      <p>Occasionally, it might be necessary to stop the communication between a node and the back office server, such as if a node is removed from a store.</p>

      <p>To stop the communication with a node, follow the steps below:</p>

      <ol>
        <li class="Steps">In the <strong>Exchange provider</strong> table, select the node for which communication must be stopped and click on the <strong>Menu</strong> button in the lower part of the table.<br>
        </li>

        <li class="Steps">Click <b>Stop</b> to stop the communication for the selected node.<br>
         The status of the node changes to "HOLD".</li>
      </ol>

      <p><img class="Text" height="362" src="Exchange_provider_files/stopping_exchanger.png" width="489"></p>

      <h3>Restarting communications</h3>

      <p>If a node has been placed <em>offline</em> on purpose, the status of the node displays "HOLD" and no messages are posted in eSuite. However, if the system loses communication with a node for any other reason, the status of that node is displayed as <em>offline</em> in the <strong>Exchange provider</strong> table. When a node is <em>offline</em>, the urgent messages must be checked to find the source of the error. Once the offline issue of the node is resolved, communication between the node and the back office server can be manually restarted in the <strong>Exchange provider</strong>.</p>

      <p class="Note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> The status of Nodes/terminals for which communication has been stopped on purpose will still be on "HOLD", even if users log back into eSuite.</p>

      <p>To manually restart the communication with a node, follow the steps below:</p>

      <ol>
        <li class="Steps">In the <strong>Exchange provider</strong> table, select the node for which communication must be restarted and click on the <strong>Menu</strong> button in the lower part of the table.<br>
        </li>

        <li class="Steps">Click <b>Restart</b> to restart the communication with the selected node.<br>
         The status of the node changes to "ONLINE".</li>
      </ol>

      <p><img class="Text" height="307" src="Exchange_provider_files/restarting_exchanger.png" width="415"></p>

      <p style="text-align:right"><a href="#Layout">Back to layout</a></p>

      <h2>Data updates once communication is established</h2>

      <p>Information exchange for any job, communication or any other event that was not successful remains in the target nodes mailboxes, so that when errors are resolved, the information is sent to the node once the communication is re-established. For example, a node is down for several days due to errors or maintenance; once the issue is resolved or the node is repaired, it will receive all price changes since the last successful communication, in the order they were sent. This will successfully update the node.</p>

      <p>Status of the node mailboxes can be checked using the <strong>MailBoxes</strong> menu in the <strong>Messages</strong> section of <strong>System</strong> module in eSuite.</p>

      <p><img class="Text" height="370" src="Exchange_provider_files/mailbox.png" width="413"></p>

      <p style="text-align:right"><a href="#Layout">Back to layout</a></p>

      <h2>Communication exchange error messages</h2>

      <p>Every failed communication produces an urgent message in the messaging system. When the <strong>Exchange provider</strong> tries to communicate again with the node and fails subsequent times with the same error, the system adds the error in the same error message. In case when the error changes or another node is involved, the system will create additional messages for those errors.</p>
